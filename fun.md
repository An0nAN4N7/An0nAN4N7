## The coding cycle

- Write code
- It doesn't work
- Cry internally
- Google the error
- Stack Overflow saves the day
- Push code
- Realize you pushed to `main` 😩

## If you've made it this far...
You either:
- Need a break 🧠
- Or you're *also* questioning your life choices 🔥

## 💻 Real Developer Workflow

1. Clone a repo
2. Break everything
3. Hack a fix together
4. Forget how it works
5. Push and pray
