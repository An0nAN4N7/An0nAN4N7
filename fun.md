## The coding cycle

- Write code
- It doesn't work
- Forget how it works
- Cry internally
- Google the error
- Stack Overflow saves the day
- Push code and pray
- Realize you pushed to `main` 😩

## 👀 Daily Mood

```
while (alive) {
    try {
        code();
        hack();
    } catch (burnout) {
        coffee++;
    }
}
```

## If you've made it this far...
You either:
- Need a break 🧠
- Or you're *also* questioning your life choices...



##  When the code doesn’t work, and Stack Overflow is silent

> *"Code. Debug. Burn it all down. Repeat."*

A little corner of chaos for those moments when the terminal fights back.

## 💬 Thought of the Day
